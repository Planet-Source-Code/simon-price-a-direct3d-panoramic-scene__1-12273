<h1 align="center">CylinderView v1.0</h1>
<h2 align="center">by Simon Price</h2>
<h2 align="center">(pictures by Craig Nisbet)</h2>
<h4 align="left">What's this?</h4>
<p align="left">CylinderView is a program that takes a .jpg or .bmp image and
wraps it onto a sphere using DirectX. It then allows you to rotate the camera
around the scene. It fools you into thinking that a whole massive 3D scene is
being rendered! Because it's really just a cylinder, it can run a phenomenal
speed - over 60 FPS on my PC!</p>
<h4 align="left">What features has it got?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Uses DirectX7 - so it must be installed!</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Loads .jpg and .bmp images</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Supports hardware and software rendering</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Variable polygon count - you choose the rendering
    quality/speed</li>
  <li>
    <p align="left">Variable picture resolution - you choose the resolution of
    the the graphics</li>
</ul>
<h4 align="left">How do I use it?</h4>
<p align="left">It's pretty self explanatory, just choose the options and click
OK. Then use the mouse to rotate the camera around. If it displays an error
message, it will end the program, but you can restart and select different
options to avoid the error by selecting software rendering of 256 x 256 pixel
textures. Press escape to end the program.</p>
<h4 align="left">I want more pictures!</h4>
<p align="left">If you want more pictures, you can make them yourself, or I
could ask Craig to make some more, and once you have them you need to put them
in the \data\maps directory for the program to find them. Make sure your
pictures have sizes that are a power of 2 - e.g. 128, 256, 512, 1024 etc. Also
understand that some 3D cards only support square textures or ones up to a
certain size.</p>
